											<p>Graduation day at Missouri State University was one of the most unforgettable moments of my life. Holding my diploma in hand, dressed in maroon, surrounded by friends, mentors, and fellow graduates—I couldn’t help but reflect on the journey that brought me here. From the very beginning, as an international student adjusting to a new environment, to taking on jobs in the library and International Services, every step taught me something valuable. I’m deeply thankful to everyone who walked beside me—professors who guided me, coworkers who supported me, and friends who stood by me, especially during the most uncertain times. To my Vietnamese peers and community who made this place feel like home—thank you. Your encouragement kept me grounded. But as one chapter closes, another begins. Life moves forward, and so do I. I’ve decided to continue my academic journey by pursuing a master’s degree in Information Technology with a focus on Data Analytics, right here at MSU. There’s still so much to learn and explore, and I’m excited to dive deeper into the world of data and innovation. Graduation wasn’t an end—it was a milestone. And I’m proud to keep growing in the place where my American journey truly began.</p>

											<p>Receiving the Certificate of Achievement at Missouri State University was a proud moment. It recognized not only my academic performance but also my efforts outside the classroom. During that time, I had the honor of performing in a Vietnamese cultural showcase at our annual banquet. We shared traditional dances, music, and stories—introducing our culture to international friends with pride and joy. Preparing for the performance was challenging, but seeing the audience's reaction made every hour of rehearsal worth it. This experience reminded me that being a student isn’t just about grades—it’s about growing as a person, sharing your roots, and building community. That night, I didn’t just feel accomplished—I felt connected, seen, and proud to represent Vietnam on a stage far from home.</p>

											<p>At Missouri State University, I had the chance to work as a student assistant in the International Services Office. It was more than just a job—it was a meaningful experience. From answering phones and organizing paperwork to helping fellow international students with immigration forms and guidance, I was trusted with responsibilities both basic and complex. Working alongside DSOs gave me a deeper understanding of how international support systems work and how important clear communication is. As someone who had gone through the same process, it felt good to give back and help others navigate their journey. Every interaction taught me something—about people, policies, and professionalism. This role not only improved my skills in organization and problem-solving but also strengthened my connection to the campus community. It reminded me why I came here: to learn, grow, and make a difference wherever I could.</p>

											<p>After spending time at Greenville University, I gained valuable experiences—academically and personally. It was where I first adjusted to life in the U.S., built friendships, and learned to navigate college as an international student. But as I grew, so did my ambitions. When I was accepted into Missouri State University’s Business Analytics program, I knew it was time for a new chapter. I wanted to take on bigger challenges and dive deeper into the field I was truly passionate about. This decision wasn’t easy, but it felt right. It represented growth, purpose, and a step closer to where I wanted to be. Moving to MSU was more than just transferring schools—it was about pushing myself to reach new heights and keeping momentum toward my long-term goals.</p>

											<p>This was my very first creative project after the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic—a propaganda-style poster with a simple but powerful message: “We Are Not Afraid.” I wanted to express strength, unity, and resilience, especially during a time when fear and uncertainty were everywhere. As an international student experiencing a global crisis far from home, this project gave me a way to channel my emotions into something visual and impactful. The raised fist, split colors, and bold typeface were all intentional—meant to stand out and speak loudly. It wasn’t just an assignment; it was my way of saying we were still standing, still fighting, and still hopeful. Looking back, this piece marked a turning point—my first step toward finding voice and purpose through design.</p>

											<p>Getting my first campus job after the COVID-19 lockdown was both a relief and a milestone. I had just started settling into life in the U.S. when everything shut down. So when I got the job moving furniture for the university, it felt like life was beginning to move forward again. It wasn’t the most glamorous role, but it gave me purpose, structure, and a way to contribute. Later, working as a student assistant in the library felt even more meaningful. It connected me to campus in a new way—helping others, being part of something, and slowly finding my place. As an international student, that mattered a lot. Each task, no matter how small, helped me grow more confident in this new chapter of my life.</p>

											<p>These photos were taken during my first days on a U.S. college campus. I remember the mix of cold air, new surroundings, and unfamiliar silence—it was both exciting and intimidating. Sitting there with my coffee, I looked around and realized just how far I’d come from Vietnam. Everything was new: the language, the people, even the way the buildings looked. But in that quiet moment, I felt a calm kind of pride. I wasn’t just visiting—I belonged here now. That wall became more than a place to sit; it marked the beginning of a chapter where I would grow, learn, and find my place in a new world.</p>

											<p>When I received my acceptance and scholarship letters from Greenville University, I sat quietly, letting it sink in. Seeing my name, the program, and the amount—$25,302 per year—felt surreal. All the long nights and quiet doubts suddenly felt worth it. As an international student from Vietnam, studying in the U.S. was a huge step, and this recognition made it feel possible. It wasn’t just financial support—it was a sign that someone believed in me. I felt proud, but also aware of the responsibility ahead. I didn’t know exactly what was coming, but I was ready to begin—with effort, gratitude, and a clear sense of purpose.</p>
